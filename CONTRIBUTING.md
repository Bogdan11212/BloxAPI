# Contributing to BloxAPI

We love your input! We want to make contributing to BloxAPI as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Code Style

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code
- Follow standard JavaScript style for JS code
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Include docstrings for all functions and classes

## Issues

### Bug Reports

When submitting a bug report, please include:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce (be specific!)
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or things you tried that didn't work)

### Feature Requests

We use GitHub issues to track feature requests. When suggesting a feature, please:

- Explain in detail how it would work
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible to make it easier to implement
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome
