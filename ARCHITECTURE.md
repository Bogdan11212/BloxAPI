# BloxAPI Architecture

This document provides an overview of the BloxAPI architecture, design patterns, and key components.

## System Overview

BloxAPI is a comprehensive REST API for interacting with the Roblox platform. It provides a clean, well-documented interface to access Roblox data, functionality, and services.

## Core Components

### 1. API Layer

The API layer handles incoming HTTP requests, authentication, rate limiting, and response formatting. It is built using Flask and Flask-RESTful.

Key files:
- `main.py`: Application entry point
- `app.py`: Flask application setup, error handlers, and middleware
- `routes/*.py`: API endpoint definitions organized by category

### 2. Service Layer

The service layer contains the business logic and coordinates communication with the Roblox API and other external services.

Key files:
- `services/*.py`: Service classes for each API category

### 3. Data Access Layer

The data access layer encapsulates the details of communicating with the Roblox API and other external services. It handles request formatting, error handling, and response parsing.

Key files:
- `clients/*.py`: API client implementations
- `models/*.py`: Data models and schemas

### 4. Utility Layer

The utility layer provides common functionality used throughout the application, such as request signing, rate limiting, caching, and logging.

Key files:
- `utils/*.py`: Utility functions and classes

## Request Flow

1. An HTTP request is received by the API layer
2. The request is validated and authenticated
3. Rate limiting is applied
4. The request is routed to the appropriate service in the service layer
5. The service calls the data access layer to communicate with the Roblox API
6. The response is formatted and returned to the client

## Design Patterns

BloxAPI uses the following design patterns:

- **Repository Pattern**: The data access layer abstracts the details of communicating with external APIs
- **Service Pattern**: Business logic is encapsulated in service classes
- **Factory Pattern**: Used to create client instances with the appropriate configuration
- **Adapter Pattern**: Used to adapt between different API interfaces
- **Decorator Pattern**: Used for cross-cutting concerns like rate limiting and caching

## Error Handling

BloxAPI implements a comprehensive error handling strategy:

1. All external API calls are wrapped in try-catch blocks
2. Errors are logged with appropriate context
3. Retries are attempted for transient failures
4. User-friendly error messages are returned to the client
5. HTTP status codes are mapped appropriately

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is implemented at multiple levels:

1. Client-side rate limiting prevents hitting Roblox API limits
2. Server-side rate limiting prevents abuse of the BloxAPI service
3. Intelligent retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

## Caching Strategy

BloxAPI implements a multi-level caching strategy:

1. In-memory caching for frequently accessed data
2. Redis-based distributed caching for horizontal scaling
3. Cache invalidation based on TTL and explicit invalidation events

## Development Guidelines

1. Follow the established architecture and design patterns
2. Document all code with docstrings
3. Write unit tests for all new functionality
4. Use type hints for better IDE support and code quality
5. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
6. Update this document when making significant architectural changes
