## Architecture Overview

BloxAPI is designed as a modern REST API service that provides a comprehensive interface to the Roblox platform. It follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

## Core Components

BloxAPI consists of several core components:

1. **API Layer**: Flask-based REST API endpoints organized by functionality
2. **Resource Managers**: Classes that handle specific Roblox resource types
3. **Authentication Service**: Handles token management and user authentication
4. **Cache Manager**: Provides efficient caching for API responses
5. **Rate Limiter**: Ensures compliance with Roblox API rate limits
6. **Logging Service**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
7. **Error Handler**: Standardized error responses and exception handling
8. **HTTP Client**: Optimized client for making requests to Roblox APIs
9. **Data Models**: Structured data objects for internal API representation
10. **Configuration System**: Environment-based configuration management

## Data Flow

The typical data flow through the system:

1. Client application makes a request to a BloxAPI endpoint
2. Request is authenticated and validated
3. Rate limiting is checked
4. Cache is queried for existing response
5. If cache miss, request is forwarded to Roblox API
6. Response is processed, transformed, and cached
7. Standardized response is returned to client

## API Structure

BloxAPI's endpoints are organized into logical categories that mirror Roblox's own API structure:

- `/api/users/*` - User-related operations
- `/api/games/*` - Game/experience operations
- `/api/assets/*` - Asset operations
- `/api/economy/*` - Economy-related operations
- `/api/groups/*` - Group-related operations
- and so on...

Each endpoint follows RESTful conventions with appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and standardized response formats.

## Error Handling

BloxAPI implements a comprehensive error handling strategy:

- All errors return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Error responses follow a consistent JSON format:
  ```json
  {
    "success": false,
    "error": {
      "code": "ERROR_CODE",
      "message": "Human-readable error message",
      "details": {}
    }
  }
  ```
- Common error scenarios are handled gracefully with retries where appropriate
- Unexpected errors are logged for debugging but present friendly messages to users

## Caching Strategy

The caching strategy balances performance with data freshness:

- Responses are cached based on resource type and frequency of change
- Cache TTLs (Time To Live) vary by endpoint:
  - User profiles: 1 hour
  - Game details: 15 minutes
  - Asset information: 24 hours
  - Real-time data (e.g., presence): 30 seconds
- Cache invalidation occurs on relevant update operations
- Redis is used as the primary cache backend
- Memory cache is used as a fallback for high-frequency requests

## Database Schema

BloxAPI uses a relational database with the following main tables:

- `users` - Stores user information and authentication details
- `api_keys` - Stores API keys for client applications
- `rate_limits` - Tracks API usage for rate limiting
- `audit_logs` - Records significant system events
- `cache_metadata` - Stores metadata about cached resources

## Security Considerations

Security is a core concern for BloxAPI:

- All API endpoints require authentication
- HTTPS is enforced for all connections
- API keys are hashed before storage
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Regular security audits are conducted
- No sensitive Roblox credentials are stored

## Performance Optimizations

BloxAPI is optimized for performance:

- Connection pooling for database and external API calls
- Batch processing for multi-item operations
- Asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations
- Efficient caching reduces load on Roblox APIs
- Response compression reduces bandwidth usage
- Database query optimization with proper indexing
- Background task processing for long-running operations

## Deployment Architecture

BloxAPI is designed for flexible deployment:

- Containerized deployment with Docker
- Horizontal scaling for high availability
- Database replication for redundancy
- Multiple deployment targets supported:
  - Self-hosted (Docker Compose)
  - Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
  - PaaS providers (Heroku, Render, Vercel)
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Blue/green deployment for zero-downtime updates
